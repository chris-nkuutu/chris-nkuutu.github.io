        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="container">
        
            <p>
                I'm a passionate and technically skilled cloud developer-student with a strong foundation in AWS and cloud platforms. 
                With hands-on experience in resource-based genome annotation for academic projects and practical labs, I bring a blend 
                of development and implementation skills to the table. Proficient in Java and containerization, I'm driven by the 
                challenge of building scalable, efficient cloud solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a team player and continuous learner, I'm eager to collaborate with designers, architects, and DevOps practitioners 
                to expand my expertise in cloud architecture, development, and deployment. I thrive in dynamic environments where 
                creativity and technical growth are encouraged, allowing me to contribute to impactful, cloud-based solutions while 
                honing my skills across various disciplines.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a person, I am a positive, humble, simple, flexible and above all fast-learning colleague who works solution-focused and meticulous. 
                Colleagues describe me as a well-liked employee with a high work ethic and who contributes to a good work environment.
                I enjoy meeting people and am a natural team player while being self-motivated. 
            </p>

            <p>
               In my free time, I prefer to spend it with my family and my two little boys out in the woods, on a bike ride or on the soccer field.
               I have a burning interest in football and therefore play both with friends in my free time and at the same time as a football coach for children. 
               With my great interest in developing in IT, there will also be a number of hours of self-study and project work even in my spare time.
               I love to challenge myself and like to learn new things and test techniques.
